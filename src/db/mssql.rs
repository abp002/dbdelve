//! The SQL Server boundary.
//!
//! tiberius is an async client with no runtime of its own, so each connection
//! owns a tokio current-thread runtime and blocks on it from the background
//! thread every call already runs on -- the arrangement the `postgres` crate
//! keeps privately around tokio-postgres, made visible here. Nothing tokio-
//! shaped leaves this module.
//!
//! The wire carries values in binary, so unlike the text protocols of the other
//! two servers every value is rendered here, in the server's own formats.
//!
//! Column provenance is learned the way Postgres learns it: by describing the
//! statement on a round trip of its own, after it ran.
//! `sys.dm_exec_describe_first_result_set` names the database, schema, table and
//! column behind each result column, and the primary key comes from the
//! catalog.
