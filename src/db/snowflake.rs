//! Snowflake, over its SQL REST API.
//!
//! There is no driver here because Snowflake publishes none for Rust, and the
//! community ones are tokio futures, which panic on GPUI's executor. What is
//! left is the documented HTTP API and a blocking client, which suits the rest
//! of this directory better than it sounds: every value arrives as a JSON
//! string, so hard rule 4's rendered text is most of the way there on arrival.
//!
//! The cost is that there is no session. Nothing set in one submission reaches
//! the next, an open transaction included, and the API refuses a `USE` outright
//! ("Command not supported by SQL API: USE") rather than running one it would
//! then forget. That is the engine's behaviour and dbdelve does not paper over
//! it: names are qualified, or resolve against the profile's database.
