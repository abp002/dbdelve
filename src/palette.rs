//!
//! The jump is flat over everything the active profile can open, so a table
//! three schemas down is a few keystrokes away without touching the tree. The
//! command palette is over verbs, and it offers only the verbs that apply to
//! what is on screen — a Run on a tab with no buffer is a row to read past.
//!
//! Neither surface decides anything. A row carries a [`Command`], the workspace
//! runs it through the same methods the buttons and keystrokes call, and the
//! palette is gone by the time it happens.
