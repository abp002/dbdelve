//! dbdelve's theme.
//!
//! Two rules hold this module together:
//!
//! 1. **Numbers drive layout, colours are paint.** Layout constants live in
//!    [`layout`] and never mix with colour tokens, so a spacing change cannot
//!    accidentally become a colour change.
//! 2. **Contrast is checked, not assumed.** Every text token is asserted
//!    against its background in the tests below. A palette edit that breaks
//!    WCAG AA fails the build.
//!
//! Dark and light are designed separately rather than mirrored, but they share
//! one elevation rule: **the closer a surface is to the data, the more light it
//! gets.** Results are the brightest plane, the editor sits one tone behind
//! them, and chrome recedes furthest — never near-black anywhere, which reads
//! as a hole rather than a surface. Tone steps, not hairlines, are what
//! separate the planes; borders are reserved for floating overlays. The one
//! structural seam, the sidebar edge, is drawn by its drag handle.
//!
//! The window is vibrant, so every plane is also a glass: see [`Theme::frost`].
