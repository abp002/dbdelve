//! TLS for the Postgres connection.
//!
//! The Rust driver ships no TLS of its own: `Client::connect` takes a connector
//! as an argument, and the `NoTls` dbdelve passed until now is a real type whose
//! whole behaviour is to refuse. That is why `sslmode` had to be rejected
//! rather than honoured — see the note on [`SslMode::parse`] for what a
//! connection string's `sslmode` actually buys you here.
//!
//! `rustls` rather than `native-tls`, because `rustls` and `rustls-native-certs`
//! were already in the dependency graph through gpui, and the latter reads the
//! platform trust store through `security-framework`, which dbdelve already
//! depends on for the Keychain. The choice costs one adapter crate instead of a
//! second TLS stack, and no OpenSSL on any platform.
//!
//! The driver's own `SslMode` has three rungs — disable, prefer, require — and
//! leaves *verification* entirely to the connector. So libpq's top two rungs are
//! `require` on the wire plus a stricter verifier in here, and the inversion
//! worth remembering is that `verify-full` is the cheap one: `rustls` checks the
//! chain and the hostname by default. It is `require` and `verify-ca`, the modes
//! that encrypt without fully establishing who answered, that need code written
//! for them.
